Let's discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the three different implementations:

Recursive Function:

Advantage:
Simple and intuitive representation of the recurrence relation.
Directly reflects the mathematical definition of the relation.
Disadvantages:
Inefficient for larger values of n due to repeated function calls and redundant computations.
Exponential time complexity, leading to slow execution and potential stack overflow for large values of n.
No memoization by default, which results in redundant computations.
Iterative Loop:

Advantages:
Efficient implementation with linear time complexity.
Avoids function call overhead and stack usage associated with recursion.
No risk of stack overflow for large values of n.
Disadvantages:
Requires maintaining additional variables to keep track of previous values.
Not as concise as the recursive approach.
Does not provide an explicit representation of the mathematical recurrence relation.
Memoization (Dynamic Programming):

Advantages:
Efficient implementation with linear time complexity, similar to the iterative approach.
Avoids redundant computations by storing intermediate results in an array (memoization).
Allows for efficient computation of F(n) for multiple values of n without recomputation.
Disadvantages:
Requires additional memory to store the memoization array.
Slightly more complex implementation compared to the iterative loop.
The memoization array size may need to be adjusted based on the maximum value of n to avoid exceeding the array bounds.
Overall, the recursive approach is the most straightforward but suffers from poor efficiency and potential stack overflow. The iterative loop and memoization approaches offer better efficiency, with the iterative loop being simpler but less expressive, while memoization provides more control over the computation and reduces redundant calculations. The choice between the iterative loop and memoization depends on the specific requirements and trade-offs of the application.
