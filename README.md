# -Question-No.-2-
The problem F(n) = F(n-3) + F(n -2) where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(2) = 2. Assume that n will be less than or equal to the maximum integer value and non-negative. You only need to write the function(s).

Development Environment:

Programming Language: C
Compiler: GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
Operating System: Any (compatible with GCC)
How to Compile and Run the Source Code:

Save the source code in a file with a '.c' extension (e.g., piecewise_recurrence.c).

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the source code file is saved.

Run the following command to compile the code:

gcc fibonacci_iterative.c -o fibonacci_iter.exe
This will generate an executable file named fibonacci_iter (or fibonacci_iter.exe on Windows).

gcc fibonacci_memoization.c -o fibonacci_memo.exe
This will generate an executable file named fibonacci_memo (or fibonacci_memo.exe on Windows).

gcc fibonacci_recursive.c -o fibonacci_recursive.exe
This will generate an executable file named fibonacci_recursive (or fibonacci_recursive.exe on Windows).

The program will execute and display the result of F(n) for the given value of n (in this case, n = 2). Feel free to modify the 'n'
